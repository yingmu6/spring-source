/**
 * Indicates that an annotated class is a "Repository"（仓库）, originally defined by
 * Domain-Driven Design 领域驱动设计 (Evans, 2003) as "a mechanism for encapsulating storage,
 * retrieval（检索）, and search behavior which emulates a collection of objects".（仓库对象处理：对一组对象中进行存储、检索、搜索）
 *
 * <p>Teams implementing traditional Jakarta EE patterns such as "Data Access Object"
 * may also apply this stereotype to DAO classes, （也可以将这种数据模型应用于DAO类）though care should be taken to
 * understand the distinction between Data Access Object and DDD-style repositories
 * before doing so. This annotation is a general-purpose stereotype and individual teams
 * may narrow their semantics and use as appropriate.
 *
 * <p>A class thus annotated is eligible for Spring
 * {@link org.springframework.dao.DataAccessException DataAccessException} translation
 * when used in conjunction with a {@link
 * org.springframework.dao.annotation.PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor
 * PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor}. The annotated class is also clarified as
 * to its role in the overall application architecture for the purpose of tooling,
 * aspects, etc.
 *
 * <p>As of Spring 2.5, this annotation also serves as a specialization of
 * {@link Component @Component}, allowing for implementation classes to be autodetected
 * through classpath scanning.
